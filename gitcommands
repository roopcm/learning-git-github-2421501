Open a shell, either a terminal or GitBash.

Check if Git is installed.  If it doesn’t return the Git version you have on your machine, please follow the steps here. 

git --version

Create a branch.  The name of the branch can be your user story id.  Eg. US308944

git   checkout -b <name-of-branch>

To work on an existing branch or switch between branches. 

git   checkout <name-of-branch>

To view the change you made (add, change or delete any files / folders):

git status

To view the differences between your local, unstaged changes and the cloned repository:

git diff

To add the local changes to the stage / index, use git add.  To add all changes in current directory and all subdirectories, use a . character.

git add   <file or folder name to add>

git add   .

To save the staged file, you will need to commit the change.  It is a good practice to provide a meaningful comment to describe the change.

git commit   -m “your comment”

To send (push) your changes made to your branch in Gitlab repository, use the push command.

git push   origin <branch-name>
